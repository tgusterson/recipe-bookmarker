# Recipe Bookmarker

This is an app built with ExpressJS to make saving the recipes you find online easier. Right now only a basic back-end exists (in the form of an API), but I will add a client to consume the API + more features soon (I'll also deploy an example to Heroku).

### Prerequisites

What you need:

* A MongoDB Atlas account.

## Running tests

This project uses Jest for testing. Simply run 'npm test' to run the test suites I've added.

## Built With

* [Express](http://expressjs.com/) - The web framework used
* [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) - Database
* [Mongoose](https://mongoosejs.com/) - ORM
